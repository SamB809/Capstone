##Myraid Cars

The goal of Myraid Cars is to create a website with a fluid experience where customers are able to register/log in and purchase cars that are available.

##Setup

This service requires Java 8

##Customer Experience

Customers can view an invintory of available cars. If they wish to purchase a car the customer must register an account with the website at which point they will be able to add cars from the inventory page into their cart.
In a future build I will add a fully flushed out checkout system so users can actually pay for the cars they wish to buy.
In a future build registered customers will be able to list their own cars for sale.

##Challenges
A challenging aespect of this website was getting the cart system to properly work. It first has to get the customer ID from when they log in, and uses that ID to interact with the inventory page so if a customer adds a car to their cart the CarId and Customer Id are saved within a seperate table in the database.
